QVideoProcessing
================

Project was designed as a common template of integration OpenCV functionality into Qt GUI.
The simplest way to start work with this project is to change the appropriate section of code
in QOpencvProcessor::custom_algorithm function in qopencvprocessor.cpp source file.
